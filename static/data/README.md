# Custom D&D Data Guide

This guide explains how to add your own custom backgrounds, classes, races, and spells to your D&D Helper application.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Auto-Detection)

**Good news!** The system now automatically detects your custom files. You can simply:

1. **Drop JSON files** into the appropriate folder (backgrounds/, classes/, races/, spells/)
2. **Use descriptive filenames** like `chef.json`, `my-custom-background.json`, etc.
3. **Click lookup** - the system will automatically find your files!

## Directory Structure

Your custom data files should be placed in the following structure:

```
static/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.json          # Index of all custom data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backgrounds/        # Custom backgrounds
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-scholar.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tavern-keeper.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ classes/           # Custom classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ races/             # Custom races
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spells/            # Custom spells
```

## How It Works (Auto-Detection)

1. **Smart Lookup Priority**: When you click a lookup button, the system will:
   - First try the official D&D 5e API
   - If not found, **automatically scan** for your custom data files
   - Display the result with a source indicator (üåê Official or üìù Custom)

2. **Auto-Detection**: The system tries multiple filename patterns:
   - `chef.json` (exact match)
   - `chef_background.json` (with underscores)
   - `custom-chef.json` (with prefix)
   - `my-chef.json` (alternative prefix)
   - And more variations...

3. **No Manual Index Required**: You don't need to update `index.json` anymore! Just drop files and they'll be found automatically.

## Adding Custom Backgrounds (Auto-Detection Method)

### 1. Create a JSON file (Auto-Detection)

Simply create a file in `static/data/backgrounds/` with a descriptive filename. The system will automatically find it!

**Recommended naming patterns:**
- `chef.json` (simple, matches the name)
- `custom-scholar.json` (with prefix)
- `my-tavern-keeper.json` (descriptive)
- `homebrew-background.json` (clear purpose)

```json
{
  "name": "Chef",
  "skillProficiencies": "",
  "languages": "",
  "equipment": "Cook's utensils, pouch of assorted spices, apron, belt pouch with 10 gp",
  "equipmentOptions": "",
  "features": [
    {
      "name": "Culinary Expertise",
      "description": "Time and effort spent mastering the culinary arts has paid off. Increase your Constitution or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Test it out!

1. Enter "Chef" in the background field
2. Click the lookup button üîç
3. Your custom background should appear with a üìù **Custom** badge

**That's it!** No need to update any index files.

## Legacy Method (Manual Index)

If you prefer explicit control or have complex setups, you can still use the manual method:

Add your new background to `static/data/index.json`:

```json
{
  "backgrounds": [
    {
      "name": "My Custom Background",
      "filename": "my-custom-background.json",
      "description": "Brief description of the background"
    }
  ],
  "classes": [],
  "races": [],
  "spells": []
}
```

## Adding Custom Classes

Create a file in `static/data/classes/`:

```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Class",
  "hitDie": 8,
  "primaryAbility": "Strength, Dexterity",
  "proficiencies": "Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons",
  "proficiencyChoices": "Choose 2 skills from: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Survival"
}
```

## Adding Custom Races

Create a file in `static/data/races/`:

```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Race",
  "size": "Medium",
  "speed": 30,
  "abilityBonuses": "Strength: +2, Constitution: +1",
  "languages": "Common, Orcish",
  "proficiencies": "Light armor, medium armor",
  "traits": "Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light\nRelentless Endurance: When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead"
}
```

## Adding Custom Spells

Create a file in `static/data/spells/`:

```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Spell",
  "level": 1,
  "school": "Evocation",
  "castingTime": "1 action",
  "range": "60 feet",
  "components": "V, S",
  "duration": "Instantaneous",
  "description": "You create a magical effect that does something awesome. The spell affects targets within range.",
  "higherLevel": "When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.",
  "classes": "Wizard, Sorcerer"
}
```

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase letters
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters
- Example: "Custom Scholar" ‚Üí `custom-scholar.json`

## Tips

1. **Backup**: Keep backups of your custom data files
2. **Testing**: Test your custom entries after adding them
3. **Validation**: Make sure your JSON is valid (use a JSON validator online)
4. **Updates**: Remember to update `index.json` when adding new files

## Example Files Included

The system comes with two example custom backgrounds:
- **Custom Scholar**: A research-focused background
- **Tavern Keeper**: A hospitality industry background

You can use these as templates for creating your own custom content.

## Troubleshooting

- **Not showing up**: Check that the filename in `index.json` matches your actual file
- **JSON errors**: Validate your JSON syntax
- **Name matching**: Make sure the name formatting is consistent (the system handles case and special characters automatically)
