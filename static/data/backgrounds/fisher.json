      "description": "You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM's discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. The theme of your tale can vary from heroic adventures to cautionary warnings about the dangers of the sea."
